## Project Setup

How does the Web App to **predict** knee osteoarthritis grade using **Deep
Learning** and **Streamlit** works?

### Clone this repository

```shell
(base)$: git clone git@github.com:mafda/knee_OA_dl_app.git
(base)$: cd knee_OA_dl_app
```

### Configure environment

- Create the conda environment

    ```shell
    (base)$: conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

- Activate the environment

    ```shell
    (base)$: conda activate knee_dl_app
    ```

- Download `model_Xception_ft.hdf5` model from
   [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vPS_j2AW3M1W8GydREEDw6CDENSgVwCy/view?usp=share_link)
   to run the application. Create `models` folder and copy the model here.

    ```shell
    (knee_dl_app)$: mkdir src/models
    ```

- Download the dataset from [Knee Osteoarthritis Dataset with Severity
   Grading](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/knee-osteoarthritis-dataset-with-severity)
   to train the model and test the application. Create `dataset` folder and copy
   the data here.

    ```shell
    (knee_dl_app)$: mkdir dataset
    ```

- Run it:

    ```shell
    (knee_dl_app)$: streamlit run app/app.py
    ```

    As soon as you run the script, a local Streamlit server will spin up, and
    your app will open in a new tab in your default web browser.

    Or you can navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
